# Current Feature: AI Suggest Description

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- Add `suggestDescription` server action in `src/actions/ai.ts` that takes a title and returns a 1-2 sentence description
- Add rate limiter for `suggestDescription` in `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
- In `create-item-dialog.tsx`, show "Suggest Description" button below description field when title is non-empty, with Sparkles icon
- In `item-drawer.tsx` edit mode, same "Suggest Description" button in description section
- Generated description populates the description field (not a chip/accept UI — just fill the textarea)
- Follow existing AI patterns (Pro gated, rate limited, uses `generate()` from `@/lib/ai`)

## Notes

- Based on existing `suggestTags` pattern — same Pro gating, rate limiting, and AI generation
- Description should be concise 1-2 sentences
- Direct textarea fill (no accept/reject chip UI like tags)
